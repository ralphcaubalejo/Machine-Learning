# Machine-Learning Project



## Predicting Residential Condominium Prices based on the features that can be seen on lamudi.com

### Introduction

One of the most lucrative business in the Philippines is the Real Estate Sector. We can see that that during the past years we have experience a sudden increase in real estate properties with the rise of many High-Rise residential Condominiums. With this at hand, it would be beneficial if we can have machine learning model that can predict the Prices of Residential Condominium based on its distinct factors like location, size no of bedrooms and no of bathrooms. This will prove to be beneficial to a lot of business sectors specially those directly doing business in the real estate sector.

### Problem Statement

Can we predict the Price Value of a Residential Condominium based on the features that can be seen on lamudi.com?
